This higher level of isolation ensures that if a VM encounters any issues or malfunctions, it does not affect the underlying host system or proxmox in this case.\nLXC: Linux Containers, consume less resources compared to vms because they share the host system\u0026rsquo;s kernel. For example, you cannot create a Windows container on a Linux kernel, as Windows cannot run on a Linux kernel. This sharing of the kernel also means that they are inherently less secure than virtual machines, as any compromise in one container can potentially affect others on the same host\nAs you can see, I use LXC for straightforward applications like DNS, VPN, and email due to their lightweight nature. Meanwhile, for the Windows10 and the router machine, I utilize VMs.\nBackup I suggest to do backup of your vms/lxc on proxmox as it is very simple and straightforward and it\u0026rsquo;s the best practice for data-recovery\nBackup option:\nConnect nas to proxmox via SMB or NFS (datacenter-\u0026gt;storage-\u0026gt;add-\u0026gt;SMB~NFS)\nUse PBS and mount the backup storage (datacenter-\u0026gt;storage-\u0026gt;add-\u0026gt;proxmox-backup-server)\nDo manual backup of your vms on an external disk.\nAs you have connect an external storage you can do manual backup or schedule it in datacenter-\u0026gt;backup (see image above)\nI suggest to do backups outside of proxmox, so even in case it fails for whatever reason, you can just restore the backups in another pve machine and be up and running again.\nAbout PBS you can install it in a VM inside proxmox but you shoud consider the point above.\nAn easy way to deploy services I use this website to quickly and easily deploy a variety of services like media-server, operating systems, Docker, and more.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/proxmoxbasicstips/","tags":["Networking","Server","Linux","PVE"],"title":"ProxmoxBasicsTips"},{"categories":null,"content":"Introduction In this tutorial I will explain you how to connect your ESP8266-01 to ThingSpeak and read some data.\nUse Arduino IDE and load this program: #include \u0026#34;DHT.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;ESP8266WiFi.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;ThingSpeak.h\u0026#34; const char * api_key = \u0026#34;abcdef\u0026#34;; const char * ssid = \u0026#34;wifi-name\u0026#34;; const char * pass = \u0026#34;wifi-password\u0026#34;; unsigned long myChannelNumber=12345678; const char* server = \u0026#34;api.thingspeak.com\u0026#34;; #define DHTPIN 2 #define DHTTYPE DHT11 DHT dht (DHTPIN, DHTTYPE); WiFiClient client; float t; float h; void setup() { ThingSpeak.begin(client); dht.begin(); Serial.begin(115200); delay(10); WiFi.begin(ssid, pass); while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) { delay(500); Serial.print(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;); } } void loop() { h = 10+dht.readHumidity(); t = dht.readTemperature(); ThingSpeak.setField(1,t); ThingSpeak.setField(2,h); ThingSpeak.writeFields(myChannelNumber,api_key); delay(2000); } Remember to change all the initial parameters: api_key = \u0026ldquo;YOUR KEY\u0026rdquo;\nssid = \u0026ldquo;wifi name\u0026rdquo;\npass = \u0026ldquo;wifi password\u0026rdquo;\nmyChannelNumber = \u0026ldquo;channel number\u0026rdquo;\nGo to Files -\u0026gt; Preferences and insert this link in “Additional Boards Manager URLs”: https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json Navigate to \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Manage Libraries.\u0026rdquo; Install the following libraries: Adafruit ESP8266\nAdafruit DHT Sensor\nThingSpeak IoT\nAs you have installed all the necessary libraries you can upload the code to your esp connected via usb serial Connect the ESP8266 to the DHT11 in this way\nESP8266:\nGND -\u0026gt; GND\nVCC -\u0026gt; 3.3V\nIO2 -\u0026gt; DHT11 Data\nIf you have done all the steps correctly you will find the data in thingspeak\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/connectesp8266withdht11sensortothingspeak/","tags":["IoT","Electronic"],"title":"Connect ESP8266 with DHT11 sensor to ThingSpeak"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
